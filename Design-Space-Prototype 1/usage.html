                          <p>A professor is teaching a course called "Intro to Data Science" He has already taught the basic concepts of DS and now he want to let students to work on a course project where they need to deploy a DS model to predict loan approval for multi-ethnic applicants based on previous 10 years data from Deutsche Bank. The professor wants to build a DS tool that helps to intervene students in the environment of Jupyter Notebook to ensure students can practise responsible data science and care about fairness of all ethnic groups.</p>
